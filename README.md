## Data Structure Overview

## Executive Summary

## Insights Deep Dive

### Bounce Rate

* Preliminary analysis of identifying top website pages highlighted that the bulk of the traffic was directed from the home page. It was the landing page for almost all the viewers.
  
  * Customer behavior showed that the bounce rate for paid marketing campaigns from the home page was quite high at 60%.
    
  *  Only 40% of people who came through paid sources browsed the website and made it past the home page.
    
* A new custom landing page was introduced to test against the default homepage. Both pages were evaluated a month after the latest landing page went live.

* Both the pages were viewed a similar amount of times and the number of bounce sessions for the new page are slightly lower.

* There was a drop in the bounce ratio between the homepage and lander-1 from ~60% to 53%
  
  * Significance testing using the z-test gives us a p-value of 0.00051 which is much lower than 0.05 giving us confidence that the drop is statistically significant.

* Trend analysis of landing pages shows that as the homepage is being phased out with the new lander-1 page, the overall bounce rate drops gradually over 5 months.

* Additionally over the same period, there is an overall increase in traffic to the website.

### Conversion Rate


## Recommendations

* It's uncertain if an increase in web traffic is due to the introduction of the new lander-1 page. It's important to evaluate if bids for paid traffic were consistent. It is also worth comparing the ratio of return customers before vs. after lander-1.
